# `require-in-the-middle` Project Governance

## Collaborators

`require-in-the-middle` core collaborators maintain the
[nodejs/require-in-the-middle](https://github.com/nodejs/require-in-the-middle)
GitHub repository. The GitHub team for `require-in-the-middle` core
collaborators is
[@nodejs/require-in-the-middle-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs/teams/require-in-the-middle-maintainers).
Collaborators have commit access to the
[nodejs/require-in-the-middle](https://github.com/nodejs/require-in-the-middle)
repository.

Both collaborators and non-collaborators may propose changes to the
`require-in-the-middle` source code. The mechanism to propose such a change is a
GitHub pull request. Collaborators review and merge (_land_) pull requests.

## PR Approval

Two collaborators must approve a pull request before the pull request can land.
Approving a pull request indicates that the collaborator accepts responsibility
for the change. Approval must be from collaborators who are not authors of the
change and at least one approval must be from a collaborator outside the authors
direct team.

If a collaborator opposes a proposed change, then the change cannot land. Often,
discussions or further changes result in collaborators removing their
opposition.
